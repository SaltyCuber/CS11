# CS11
All the work I have to do for my cs11 class

meth.py is an alternate way of doing integer math using only bitwise nor and bitwise left and right shifts, and was something I did just for fun

coin_count.py and coin_count_no_meth.py are my unit 2 project, the latter being a more readable version

bee.py is my unit 3 project

blackjack.py is my unit 4 project, and requires python 3.10

tic_tac_toe.py is my final project, and reference image.png is what i used to get coordinates for everything.
